Exercises need to be interpreted first `scalac s1a.scala`, `scalac s1b.scala`, `scalac s2a.scala` and `scalac s2b.scala`. Then you can use the prodrams by running:

- `scala timer1` runs a timer app with immutable MinSek object
- `scala timer2` runs a timer app with mutable MinSek object
- `scala prime` calculates prime numbers
- `scala interpreter` opens a repl with ls command with some options to list file names in current directory
